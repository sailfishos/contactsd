Basic installation
===============================================================================

The simplest way to compile this package is:

1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
   `./configure' to configure the package for your system.

2. Type `make' to compile the package.

3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any unit-tests that come with
   the package.

4. Type `make install' to install the program, plugins, and any data files.
   When installing into a prefix owned by root, it is recommended that the
   package be configured and built as a regular user, and only the
   `make install' phase executed with root privileges.

===============================================================================
Running
===============================================================================

After build a binary "contactsd" will be available inside the src/ directory
located inside the build directory.

===============================================================================
Generating debian packages
===============================================================================

To generate debian packages run:

1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
   `dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -b'  to generate the debian packages.

Optionally, if you're not the current maintainer, you can create an unsigned
package using the "-us -uc" parameters when running `dpkg-buildpakage'.
